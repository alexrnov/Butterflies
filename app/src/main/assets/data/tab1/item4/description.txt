Papilio joanae, the Ozark swallowtail, is a North American butterfly species in the family Papilionidae. It was once considered a synonym of the black swallowtail (Papilio polyxenes).

The Ozark swallowtail is almost identical to the black swallowtail. Despite this similarity, an analysis of the Ozark swallowtail's mitochondrial DNA suggests that it is actually more closely related to the Old World swallowtail (Papilio machaon). On both surfaces of the hindwing, the pupil in the eyespot usually touches the edge of the inner margin. On the underside of the hindwing, the orange spots have very little or no yellow in them.

P. joanae is found in cedar glades and woodland habitats.
